# Awesome Conky
My simple but awesome conky configuration. Feel free to fork and use it yourself. Though it will require some work to setup.

### Usage
1. All the files need to be dropped into `.conky` folder inside your home directory i.e. `~/.conky/`

2. Fonts should be installed to `/usr/share/fonts/` and then executing `sudo fc-cache -fv`
